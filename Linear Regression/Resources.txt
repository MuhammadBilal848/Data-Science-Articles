PS:
A Linear Regression model’s main aim is to find the best fit linear line and the optimal values of intercept and coefficients such that the error is minimized.
Error is the difference between the actual value and Predicted value and the goal is to reduce this difference.
Q.
How do we know which line is best fit line?
A.
For starters you can try dropping multiple lines on a graph and calculating distance of each line with different data points called margin of error (ε).
In the end a line having the minimum margin of error will be chosen as a best fit line.
